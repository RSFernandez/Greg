# Greg
Space Abandoned VR

While passing through the Dao-29 System, the F.S.S. Damien Grey detected a faint signal on the far side of Birtola-9. After closing in on the source, the ship identified the signal as Sergeant Golgo "Greg" Mukayama, chief technical officer of a lunar expeditionary team investigating an abandoned moon base.

A rogue lieutenant commissioned the expedition, but he led the team into a trap.

Now everyone is dead, killed by a rogue AI they call "A.D.A.A.M".

You are a Federation Scout Trooper; your job is to find Greg and bring him back to the ship in one piece.
